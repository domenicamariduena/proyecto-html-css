        <p> Hermione was born to Mr and Mrs Granger on 19 September 1979. 
            She was their only child.The couple choose "a nice, unusual" first name for her 
            because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were.</p>
        
        <p>Upon turning eleven, Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend Hogwarts. 
            She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the September of 1991, 
            learning all the set spell books by heart and even managing to perform "a few spells" at home successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, 
            Hermione brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the wizarding world, to the point that she had looked 
            at books and had more knowledge of the wizarding world than some of her pure-blood/half-blood classmates.

        <p>Hermione enjoyed her years as a pupil at Hogwarts and took assignments, classes, and school rules very seriously. She was often described as brilliant, to the point of 
            being said to be "the brightest witch of her age". Her favourite subject was initially Charms, and later Arithmancy. Given her keen mind, some students — such 
            as Terry Boot — wondered why Hermione was Sorted into Gryffindor rather than Ravenclaw, and she admitted that the Sorting Hat did consider putting her in Ravenclaw. 
            It is likely that the Sorting Hat ultimately put her in Gryffindor after stalling for about 4 minutes because Hermione chose to be in it, just like Harry chose to not be in Slytherin; this 
            is reinforced by how the train earlier she stated that "Gryffindor... sounds by far the best."</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="espacio">   </div>
        </div>
        <p>She later proved her rightful place in Gryffindor with her steadfast bravery and loyalty to her friends, Hogwarts, and Dumbledore's Army. After being Sorted into Gryffindor, Hermione shared a dormitory with Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Fay Dunbar and an unnamed ginger-haired girl.
            In spite of always wanting to follow the school rules, after Hermione became friends with Harry and Ron, she would disobey the rules along with them in order to successfully complete their group affairs. For example, she went with Ron and Harry into the third-floor corridor in their first year, 
            which students were temporarily forbidden from entering, in order to save the Philosopher's Stone; she assisted in creating the Polyjuice Potion in their second year; and although Harry was the one who taught Dumbledore's Army in their fifth year, she was the one who came up with the idea.</p>

            <p>Hermione was a couple of weeks away from turning twelve when she boarded the Hogwarts Express in 1991, where she met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley while helping Neville Longbottom find his pet toad, Trevor. 
                Hermione demonstrated knowledge and talent with magic beyond most of those her age, 
                despite having only recently discovered that she was a witch. She wished to be a Gryffindor or a Ravenclaw, and her wish was granted considering she did get sorted into Gryffindor.
                Hermione soon proved to be the best in all her classes, eager to please the professors and to help others learn, albeit in a bossy way that made it difficult for her to make friends. 
                Although she was a know-it-all, Hermione did often help Neville Longbottom, who struggled in most classes other than 
                Hermione strictly followed all school rules and tried to prevent other students from breaking rules and getting into trouble. On one night, she followed Harry and Ron as they were leaving Gryffindor Tower to duel Draco Malfoy. They were chased by Argus Filch, 
                acting on a tipoff by Malfoy, into the third-floor corridor — forbidden to students — where they came face-to-face with Fluffy, a three-headed dog belonging to Hagrid. Later on, she argued that her spying was to their benefit when she pointed out the dog had been standing 
                on a trapdoor, which neither Harry nor Ron had noticed</p>

            <p>The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was solidified when, on Hallowe'en in 1991, the three were forced to confront a mountain troll, which had been secretly let into the school by Professor Quirinus Quirrell. Unaware that a troll was on the loose in the school, 
                Hermione had spent that day crying in the girls' bathroom after overhearing Ron making unkind comments about her.
                The troll made its way into the bathroom she was in, and Harry and Ron came to her rescue, saving her. When Professors Minerva McGonagall, Severus Snape and Quirinus Quirrell arrived at the scene, Hermione covered for the boys, 
                claiming she was fighting the troll because she had thought that she could manage, having read a great deal about them and that Ron and Harry had merely come to help her escape. From then on, the three students were best 
                friends and spent large amounts of time together</p>

            <p>Before she started her second year, Hermione wrote several letters to Harry at Privet Drive, all of which were intercepted by Dobby, as the house-elf wanted Harry to believe that his friends had forgotten him in order to prevent his return to Hogwarts. 
                She and her parents also accompanied Harry and the Weasley family to 
                Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies.
                Draco Malfoy calling Hermione the derogatory slur "Mudblood"
                It was during her second school year that Hermione first encountered the prejudice and hatred surrounding her blood status, when Draco Malfoy called her a "filthy little Mudblood" after she told him off for insulting the Gryffindor Quidditch team. 
                Hermione had never heard the highly offensive term but looking around at everyone around her, it was an obvious fact. Fred and George Weasley lunged at him, and Ron even tried to hex him, but it backfired, as his wand had been damaged. To help Hermione feel better about the incident, 
                Hagrid urged her not to think about it, pointing out that she was a talented witch, regardless of what bigoted people said about her Muggle-born status</p>

            <p>On Hallowe'en 1992 Hermione attended Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party with Harry and Ron. Whilst heading back upstairs, she followed Harry in a detour, after he claimed to be hearing voices. 
                They discovered the caretaker's cat, Mrs Norris, petrified and the walls vandalised. Hermione began spending all her free time in the Hogwarts Library after she saw the writing on the corridor walls, 
                which had said that the Chamber of Secrets had been re-opened. Despite hoping to read about the legend, she could not, as all the books had been previously checked out</p>
            <p>Hermione shocked everyone when she actually interrupted Professor Binns during a History of Magic class, asking about the Chamber of Secrets. This was the only known time when a student had asked the boring professor a question, and the class was interested in what he had to say. 
                Professor Binns had stated that Salazar Slytherin had hidden a chamber which consisted of a horrible monster. It had been unleashed before once by an "Heir of Slytherin", petrifying many Muggle-born and had also killed a Ravenclaw girl, named Myrtle Warren, who began haunting the girls' 
                lavatory and became known as Moaning Myrtle. Slytherin, a pure-blood loyalist, was against Muggle-born children being allowed to attend Hogwarts, but he was outnumbered by the other founders and Muggle-borns like Hermione were permitted as students. Slytherin fled the school, 
                but rumours spread that he had built a hidden chamber; it was said that the school had been searched many times, but no such chamber had been found</p>

            <p>Hermione comes from a family of Muggles (non-wizards), so it makes sense that her surname is a bit more traditional 
                than some of her Hogwarts classmates.But Granger wasn't the author's original choice. 
                According to a 2015 article on Wizarding World (formerly Pottermore) where Rowling revealed the first 40 character names 
                she came up with for "Harry Potter," Hermione's last name was originally Puckle.</p>

                Hermione was a stickler for the rules throughout most of the series, but there were times when she felt the need to go against the law.
                For example, in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," she used an undetectable extension charm on her bag in order to fit all the supplies the 
                trio needed on their quest for the Horcruxes.According to Wizarding World, these charms are illegal for private use and are only intended 
                for the production of objects like school trunks and family tents
                In "Sorcerer's Stone," she also told Ron while they were riding the Hogwarts Express that she'd already tried out a few spells 
                before starting school. But later on in the series, we learn that underage students aren't allowed to practice magic outside of Hogwarts.
